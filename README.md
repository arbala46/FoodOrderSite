Project Name: Food Order Website
This project is a simple food ordering webpage created using only HTML and CSS. The website showcases a user-friendly design with menus and categories. Users can browse through the available food items and place orders. While it doesn't include backend functionality, it serves as a front-end prototype to demonstrate layout design, styling, and responsiveness.
